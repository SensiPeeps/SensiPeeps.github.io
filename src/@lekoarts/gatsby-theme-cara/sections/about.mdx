## Who we are

#### We're a group of Android and Tech enthusiasts that love playing and tinkering around with code, seeing how our shit ends up.

Our members initially started off forming with five of us using an Android custom ROM, Havoc OS. We were rather active in their 
Telegram support chat, and slowly got to know each other better. Eventually, we made a group on Telegram and started tinkering playing 
with code, building custom ROMs and learning new languages. Since then, we've kept building, modifying, forked and written our open-source 
projects on GitHub, which led to where we are now.
